## How to use:
- click on **Use Template** to clone this template in your project
- comment the services you are not using from docker-compose file
- then you can directly run docker-compose command:  
```console
docker-compose up -d
```

- by default all the unicorn requests are sent to nginx and you can check these requests being served at *localhost* (by default)  
  `you can update nginx configurations by updating default.conf file`
